<h1>Analyzing network structure and security


<h2>Description</h2>

This project involves the creation of an incident report following a network incident using the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF). The incident report will utilize the CSF's standards, guidelines, and best practices to thoroughly analyze the incident and provide recommendations for mitigating future risks.

By applying the NIST CSF, the project aims to demonstrate a proactive approach to cybersecurity risk management. It emphasizes the importance of effective communication and transparency with stakeholders while improving overall security practices within the organization.
